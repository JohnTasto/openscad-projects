# OpenSCAD Projects

These are my personal OpenSCAD drawings. This will hopefully be more organized soon;  I unfortunately always have too many ongoing projects. Getting these on GitHub was a major feat.

There are many designs here that are not on Thingiverse or anywwhere else yet. Many have to do with my BIBO2, a Replicator clone.

- y carriages that have a wire brush and a pocket for the BL-Touch
- parametric reusable pleated filter (HEPA/carbon/both)
- inside printer cabinet air scrubber with switch panel for anything you might like to switch
- repeatable easy to read slop calibration test
- a method that fills any polygon with a pattern that prints as a single wall grid or screen in long, unbroken lines
- cat grass trays with a snap in screen to prevent seeds being pulled up. Trays snap together on their corners
- small parts drawers with bins. Modular at several levels, parametric, several handle options, prints in vase mode, includes trim
